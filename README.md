A coffee ordering app

Author: Peter Tsampakiouris

Introduction

This is a small (and pretty trivial for the moment) Android app developed through watching Udacity's Android Developement For Beginners lesson. So far it's development is for educational purposes mainly and for fun.

Usage

User selects a quantity and presses the order button to see the total price

To run the app go to bin folder and install the JustJava.apk file to your Android device.
