# JustJava
A coffee ordering app

Author: Peter Tsampakiouris

Introduction

This is a small (and pretty trivial for the moment) Android app developed through watching Udacity's Android Developement For Beginners lesson. So far it's development is for educational purposes mainly and for fun.

Usage

User inputs name.
Then user selects additional choices (if any) for his/her coffee.
Then he/she selects a quantity and finally hits the order button where a summary of the order is displayed.

To run the app go to bin folder and install the JustJava.apk file to your Android device.
